# cvp-cluster submodule
This submodule is intended to be used by the `cvp-in-gcp` module. It does not perform several validations so do not use it directly unless you know what you're doing. **Doing so may break functionality in unintended and unpredictable ways**.

Also, documentation isn't nearly as good.
